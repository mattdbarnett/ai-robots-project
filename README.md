This project is a randomly generated robot simulator. When began, robots are created and placed with randomly chosen traits - such as apperance, speed and home location - and compete with eachother to obtain food and have children. If a single robot's hunger goes below zero, they die at the end of the current season.

## User Controls
 - **F** - Toggles fullscreen
 - **R** - Restarts the simulation from Round 1, Spring.
 - **Esc** - If the user is currently on the simulation, exits to the menu scene. If the user is currently on the menu scene, closes the application.
